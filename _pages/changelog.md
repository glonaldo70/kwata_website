## `Latest`

### **Version 1.0.0 - Professional E-commerce Evolution**

Major update focused on professionalizing the user experience and aligning terminology with e-commerce standards. The application has undergone a complete textual overhaul to provide clearer, more reassuring, and commercially oriented guidance for both buyers and sellers.

#### Key Improvements

- **Professional Terminology**: Transitioned from generic terms to specific e-commerce vocabulary (e.g., "Grand Marché" → "Mode Acheteur", "Porte-points" → "Portefeuille de Crédits").
- **Enhanced User Guidance**: Rewrote instructional texts in onboarding, product creation, and search flows to be more directive and helpful.
- **Clearer Value Propositions**: Improved descriptions for becoming a seller ("Vendeur Kwata") and the benefits of the platform.
- **Standardized UI Text**: Harmonized labels for buttons, dialogs, and form fields across the app (Sign Up, Login, Settings, Delivery).

#### Detailed Changes

- **Authentication**: Clearer "Sign Up" and "Login" flows with professional welcome messages.
- **Navigation**: Renamed menu items for better clarity ("Paramètres & Ressources", "Centre d'Assistance").
- **Marketplace Features**:
  - "Photos du Produit" instead of "Illustrations".
  - "Spécifications" instead of "Exigeances".
  - "Tarification" instead of "Prix".
